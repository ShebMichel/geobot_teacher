# Training gemma_2b_en For a Conversational Chatbot using Kaggle 

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build a chatbot using the Kaggle model Gemma 2 (gemma_2b_en)

## Load Model

KerasNLP includes implementations of various popular model architectures. In this tutorial, youâ€™ll use GemmaCausalLM, a complete Gemma model for causal language modeling. Causal language modeling predicts the next token by analyzing previous tokens.

To create and load a model from_preset such as

gemma_lm = keras_nlp.models.GemmaCausalLM.from_preset("gemma_2b_en")

Alternatively, you can download and unzip the model from or run a Python script to download the model from your local

## Bot Testing

The frontend is implemented using `gradio` as well as `Huggingface`.
